Motivation
Understanding student performance patterns is crucial for educators to tailor learning experiences and improve academic success. This project aims to provide insights into how gender, parental education, and test preparation influence student outcomes, enabling data-driven strategies for educational improvement.

Data Source
The analysis is performed on a student performance dataset containing scores in math, reading, and writing, along with demographic and educational background information such as gender, parent education level, and test preparation status.

Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas to handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.
Exploratory data analysis through visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify meaningful patterns and correlations.
Use of boxplots, bar charts, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps to communicate insights clearly.

Results
Identified key trends indicating female students generally outperform males in reading and writing.
Found parental education positively correlates with student math performance, highlighting the role of family environment.
Demonstrated test preparation has a significant impact on improving writing and reading scores.

Future Work
Integrate additional demographic variables for more granular analysis.
Develop predictive models to forecast student performance and identify at-risk students.
Extend the dashboard to support real-time data updates and interactive filtering.
